# Release Engineering

Simplify project maintenance with shared GitHub Actions workflows that
enable privilege separation, facilitate reproducible builds, and
support matrix strategies.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Workflows in other private repositories in this organization
> **MUST** be able to access this repository.  For more information,
> refer to
> [Sharing actions and workflows from your private repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/reuse-automations/share-across-private-repositories).

[_Good DevOps Practice_](https://github.com/ResearchDataCom/good-devops-practice)
describes the underlying methodology and recommended tooling in
greater detail.  For an example of how to use these workflows, refer
to the
[Python project template's CI workflow](https://github.com/ResearchDataCom/good-devops-practice/blob/main/python-template/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.package_slug%20%7D%7D/.github/workflows/ci.yaml).

## Available Workflows

Workflows are listed in alphabetical order.  Refer to the linked
workflow definitions for additional details.
